## note
IOnic view is giving me a lil trouble. from windows to view on my iphone. it complains of cordova plugins not preloading when i build the files. 
so i personally didnt see the response from ur server to get the `parse text` u were talking about in the audio u sent via whatsapp

at the moment i have to leave to town for couple of activities. so i will resolve it by night.
